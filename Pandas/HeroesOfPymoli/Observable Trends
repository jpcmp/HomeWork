  Although the vast majority of the players identify themselves as males (84.03%), they tend to spend less when doing in-game purchases. Breaking down the amount of money spent per person, female and not disclosed gender players spend more, with higher ticket purchases.
  People with ages between 20 and 25 represent almost half of the players of the game, 44.79% to be precise. They are also top three when it comes to average total purchase per person with $4.32. They fall behind only to people between 35 and 39 years old ($4.76) and people below 10 years of age ($4.54).
  The item price doesn't seem to be a relevant factor in the players decisions. The top three items are priced above $4.00 while there are many items with much inferior prices on the list.
