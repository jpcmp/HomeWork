  As expected, when comparing the school's overall passing percentages it is clear that schools that have less than 2,000 students tend to have a better outcome than the ones with a larger number of students. The thresholds of schools with less than 1,000 students and schools with 1,000 to 2,000 students have overall passing percentages of 94.82% and 95.20% respectively, while schools with 2,000 to 5,000 students' overall passing percentages fall to 76.36%.
  Now when comparing budgets, I see as a surprise that the average amount spend per student is not an indicator of the overall passing percentages. The groups of schools that spent above $615.00 had only 80.89% for schools spending from $615.00 to $645.00, and 73.65% for schools spending from $645.00 to $675.00. Schools that spent less than $585.00 and from $585.00 to $615.00 performed much better, obtaining 95.04% and 95.07% overall passing percentages respectively.
