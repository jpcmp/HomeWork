The maximum temperature tends to decrease once latitude of the cities move away from 0.
The decrease was deeper on the latitude movement away from 0 towards the positive side. On the negative side the impact in the temperature was realatively weaker.
Humidity, cloudiness and wind speed did not seem to present any meaningful correlation with the cities' latitude location.
